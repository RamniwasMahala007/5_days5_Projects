[Demo Here](https://ramniwasmahala007.github.io/5_days5_Projects/1-Drag&Drop_Browser/)

## Things I learned :--
>In HTML:

- while adding the font awesome link, I used the class `<i class="fas fa-images"></i>` in which image icon generate.

>In CSS:
- In css `background: -webkit-linear-gradient(to right #cfdef3, #e0eafc);` is used for only chrome and safari.
  - The `linear-gradient()` CSS function creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two   or more colors along a straight line.

-`cursor-pointer`  The cursor is a pointer that indicates a link. it is applied on browser text as class name button.
